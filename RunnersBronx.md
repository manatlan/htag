#RunnersBronx

This term "Bronx" is just here to define the current troubles with "all runners". ANd I would like to clarify all, before releasing the long awaited "1.0" ;-)

There are several troubles:

 1) continue to provide embbeded runners with htag module ? (or make them in separate libs)
 2) Signatures differs (a bit) from a runner to another one
 3) spezialize the way it should work. Because some can use more features than others
 4) and ensure current compatibilities (at least with latests htag 0.10/0.11)
