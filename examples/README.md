Since **htag** can run in **pyscript**, you can execute this 5 examples, in your browser ;-)

 - [pyscript.html](https://raw.githack.com/manatlan/htag/main/examples/pyscript.html), a simple and minimal example
 - [pyscript_demo.html](https://raw.githack.com/manatlan/htag/main/examples/pyscript_demo.html), a simple editor to test its own htag's Tags, in a pyscript context.
 - [pyscript_with_hashchange.html](https://raw.githack.com/manatlan/htag/main/examples/pyscript_with_hashchange.html), an example using a component which listening hash event, and react on hashchange (can use navigation history) 
 - [pyscript_htbulma.html](https://raw.githack.com/manatlan/htag/main/examples/pyscript_htbulma.html), which use [htbulma](https://github.com/manatlan/htbulma) **DEPRECATED**, a lib of pre-made htag's components.
 - [pyscript_htagui.html](https://raw.githack.com/manatlan/htag/main/examples/pyscript_htagui.html), which use [htagui](https://github.com/manatlan/htagui), a lib of pre-made htag's components.
 - [pyscript_matplotlib.html](https://raw.githack.com/manatlan/htag/main/examples/pyscript_matplotlib.html), an example using **matplotlib** (which works in pyscript too) ;-)

All theses things, will work in a simple html page (no (real) python required)
